      <description>Vortex is an open source computer music system by Mads Kjeldgaard for improvisation and composition. It is written as a package for the SuperCollider programming environment.
It is inspired by reel to reel tape recorders, cybernetic and feedback music as well as more contemporary generative systems.
At it&amp;rsquo;s core it has a complex web of sound processes divided in voices, all of them interconnected in feedback paths and outputting their sound to digital looping varispeed tape reels.</description>

              Mutable Instruments is an absolutely amazing synthesizer company that produces open source hardware with open source firmware on it. I have several of these and I love poking around in the firmware.
The company has even open sourced it&rsquo;s development environment which on most systems may be setup in a virtual machine.
But this is not so easy on Arch Linux, since these virtual machines rely on old(er) kernels, and I am always on bleeding edge kernel versions on my development laptop, so I decided to setup my own little development environment for hacking Mutable Instruments (and similar) firmwares directly in Arch with no virtual machines used and it seems to work quite nicely.

              Lately I have been experimenting with 14bit MIDI and found it to be a huge revelation for my work with SuperCollider. Often, the regular data range of MIDI (0-127) is way too choppy and coarse for nice interactions with your systems and instruments in SuperCollider, but 14 bit MIDI provides a resolution of 16384 steps which is great. This is actually achieved quite cleverly by combining two MIDI CC signals in to one.

              Inspired by this blog post, I have been toying with a silly idea lately: A completely portable Arch Linux distribution set up properly for computer music, but flashed onto a USB thumb drive so that I may pop it into any computer, boot from the thumb drive and start creating music on whatever hardware is in front of me.
I have achieved this now using the awesome alma project. Alma is a tool for creating persistent USB installations of Arch Linux using a series of configuration files and bash scripts called presets.

              One of the big hurdles for me when switching from a Mac based audio setup was the potential loss of access to my expensive collection of VST plugins (because a lot of developers still ignore the Linux platform as if it was 1995 even though it has never been easier to make and release cross platform plugins). Little did I know that almost all of them would run just fine on Linux using the wine Windows compatibility layer and the linvst VST plugin bridging software.

              These are notes I have been taking while making packages for the Arch User Repository, a community based package repository for users of Arch Linux and it&rsquo;s derivative operating systems. This isn&rsquo;t a complete guide and certainly not beginner friendly but should help some people with some linux experience get started.
If you have a tolerance for YouTube videos, then maybe this video will be helpful to you.
It is also recommend to read the official guide on how to create packages: Creating packages.

              A cloud generator is basically a synthesis process that generates a lot of micro sound events (grains) at the same time. This as a whole becomes a bigger textural structure called a &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; generally.
  I have done a lot of experiments lately using SuperCollider&rsquo;s pattern library to sequence micro compositions on a per-sound-particle basis, but to take a break from that work (which rarely leads to succesful results I have to say), I challenged myself a bit and tried to make an audio rate granular synthesis cloud generator.

              Today I did a small experiment with my Raspberry Pi 4: I wanted to poll the GPIO data pins and use data from them in SuperCollider. This is best done by polling the pins in a separate program and then sending that data to SuperCollider via OSC.
I have done this in Python before but I much prefer doing this kind of thing in Rust since the latter is fast and safe (and just generally: I love Rust!

              These are notes for setting up YouCompleteMe - a program for autocompletion, code linting and debugging in the text editor Vim - for developing Rust programs. I find this program vital to my Rust workflow because it allows me to more easily explore code and correct mistakes before they reach the compiler. YouCompleteMe will tell you if there are syntactic mistakes in your code, it will tell you about unused variables and code and it will often suggest changes to problematic code.

              At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis the Danish artist Claus Haxholm reached out to me to do an interview by email. It turned out to be a lengthy email exchange which resulted in an interview available on the Danish music website Passive/Aggressive.
In the interview (which is in Danish unfortunately) I talk about the brain, morphology, Norway, time and different speculative subjects related to computer music, as well as my Vortex system.

              My Ornament &amp; Crime build (the Mini OC version). The USB connector on the Teensy on the back of the module has been rewired to a Neutrik USB connector attached to a panel next to it (the grey panel).
I have tried quite a few different approaches to integrating my modular synthesizer with my SuperCollider workflow and I have found most them to be disappointing, extremely expensive and or inflexible.

              Jack is an incredibly flexible piece of software for making audio connections. It&rsquo;s mostly used to connect and patch virtually within one computer but it has a range of amazing extra features for connecting things in alternative ways.
This is exploited to it&rsquo;s fullest in the zita-njbridge package.
To quote from the manual on zita-njbridge:
 The zita-j2n (sender) and zita-n2j (receiver) applications allow to exchange up to 64 channels of full-quality uncompressed audio streams between two or more systems running the Jack audio server.

              These are notes for setting up a Raspberry Pi 4 single board computer for pro audio work. Specifically for running SuperCollider programs for interactive installations.
I used Raspbian Lite for this, since my intention is to run the Raspberry Pi in headless mode, meaning using no display and no desktop environment (to save resources).
It is presumed that you have installed Raspbian on an SD card, with ssh enabled (allowing you to log in to the pi over the network and execute commands using a terminal), and that you are logged in.

              A while ago I started compiling a list of links to SuperCollider based things that I found interesting and wanted to save for later.
The list grew and at one point I organized it all in one public repository where the SuperCollider community could help curate links to awesome SuperCollider things and it has since then become a truly rich resource for things like tutorials, reading material, nice projects and tools.

              Nannou is a relatively new framework for creative coding ⨪ kind of like processing, openFrameworks and cinder.
A creative coding framework usually consists of a cluster of tools for working creatively with audio, visuals, robotics, lasers and many other things in one coding framework, and nannou is no different.
The great thing about nannou is that it is a framework making use of the cool new systems programming language Rust.

              In this tutorial, I will cover how to install and setup SoX on android devices using Termux.
Termux is a free “Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that works directly with no rooting or setup required”.
Basically it is a command line interface for your Android device and works like a small linux distribution. It even includes a package management system. And if you get something like an OTG-dongle you can even connect a keyboard and/or a class compliant sound interface.

              To make full use of SoX' potential for batch processing we will be using a bit of command line wizardry.
The idea is to put our sox command inside of a for-loop which iterates over all audio files in the folder you are currently in. If you are unsure of what folder your terminal is executing from, you can write pwd to see it&rsquo;s full path and ls to see the folder&rsquo;s contents.

              SoX has a very effective and rather precise way of semi-automatically chopping a sound file into smaller sound files.
Let us say you have a sound file containing many different sounds seperated by a bit of silence in between. It could be a series of drum hits that you have recorded off of a drum machine. To make these sounds easy to use, you most probably need them as seperate sound files so you can load them into a sampler or other software as a sample bank of sorts.

              SoX is a very powerful command line audio processing tool. You can think of it as a sort of command line equivalent of Audacity but with a text based interface that let&rsquo;s you perform powerful audio operations by typing just a few words in your computer&rsquo;s terminal.
I came across SoX via the live coding community where it is a popular tool for chopping sound files (by detecting silence) and batch processing large quantities of audio files (eg.

              It is possible to get a nice development environment on Linux (and other platforms) using NeoVim and a few plugins and settings.
This dev environment includes snippets, autocomplete, debugging and smart code suggestions for methods.
I got a lot of pointers for this setup from Chendi Xue’s blogpost about Vim/CPP development.
So, without further ado here are my notes for setting up shop using YouCompleteMe, UltiSnips and some formatting plugins.

              The default synth sound in SuperCollider is a cheesy old piano sound. If you have ever tried the event pattern examples in the documentation of SuperCollider or been in the process of testing some pattern specifics of your own, you will have heard this extremely unconvincing synthesizer:
A nice alternative: A triangle wave synth with a low pass filter #  Imagine a utopian world where the default cheese-piano-synth has been replaced by a nicer, kind of gameboy like synth.

              Hedrot is an inexpensive head rotator that you can build yourself and attach to any pair of head phones, based on a small microcontroller (a Teensy) with an attached sensor board that measures your head’s rotation, pitch, tilt, etc.
Using the Hedrot, you can monitor a binaural version of an ambisonic mix in a pair of headphones and be able to move your head around inside the sound field.
In this tutorial we will cover how to set up the Hedrot application to send it’s sensor data via OSC to Reaper to rotate our ambisonic mix with our head movements.

              In SuperCollider, one of the most common ways of making sounds is by first defining a sort of recipe for a UGEN patch in a SynthDef and then from that recipe produce Synths that make sounds.
But when you write a SynthDef, the patch architecture cannot change after the definition (as opposed to changing arguments in the patch).
This becomes annoying when working with UGens that want to know the exact number of channels used, eg.

              One of the many powerful features of SuperCollider is it’s ability to render sounds offline. This is called Non-Realtime Synthesis (NRT). NRT is for example useful for fast, offline processing of sounds, doing sound analysis or rendering generative compositions.
NRT works like this (normally): First you write a list of server OSC messages (stored in a Score usually) which will tell the (offline) server what to do at what point in time when you decide to render it.

              I recently built version 2 of a &ldquo;master volume control&rdquo; midi controller that I had made before. This version is slightly improved on the former.
It is very cheap and simple. It revolves around the wonderful and cheap (11$) Teensy LC.
Bill of materials includes:
 A 10k potentiometer A button A Teensy LC A box (I used a leftover box that had contained some wood screws - perfect size!) A few wires  All code and notes for building may be found here.

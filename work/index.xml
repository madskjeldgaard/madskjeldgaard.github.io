      <description>“I solens flint 1000 floder” is an electronic composition by Mads Kjeldgaard comissioned by Notam and Ultima Festival 2019.
It was composed in 7th order ambisonics, partly at NOTAM in Oslo, Norway, and partly at EMS, Stockholm, Sweden, for a 3D audio speaker dome set up in Oslo as part of Ultima Festival 2019.
The title (which is in Danish) can be translated to something along the lines of “In the shard of the sun 1000 rivers”.</description>

      <description>Verdenskværnen (&amp;ldquo;The world grinder&amp;rdquo;) is a composition inspired by the Swedish author August Strindberg&amp;rsquo;s rambling, autobiographical novel &amp;ldquo;Inferno&amp;rdquo; (1898) as well as the sounds of gentrification.
It explores different ideas of sonic tactility in it&amp;rsquo;s sound material.
 &amp;ldquo;The sun shines, everyday life proceeds on its usual course, the cheerful bustle of business raises the spirits. Then one feels rebellious, and challenges heaven with doubts. But when night, silence, and loneliness reign, the heart beats, and the breast suffers from constriction.</description>

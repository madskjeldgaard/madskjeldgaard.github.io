      <description>Nannou is a relatively new framework for creative coding ⨪ kind of like processing, openFrameworks and cinder.
A creative coding framework usually consists of a cluster of tools for working creatively with audio, visuals, robotics, lasers and many other things in one coding framework, and nannou is no different.
The great thing about nannou is that it is a framework making use of the cool new systems programming language Rust.</description>

      <description>It is possible to get a nice development environment on Linux (and other platforms) using NeoVim and a few plugins and settings.
This dev environment includes snippets, autocomplete, debugging and smart code suggestions for methods.
I got a lot of pointers for this setup from Chendi Xue’s blogpost about Vim/CPP development.
So, without further ado here are my notes for setting up shop using YouCompleteMe, UltiSnips and some formatting plugins.</description>

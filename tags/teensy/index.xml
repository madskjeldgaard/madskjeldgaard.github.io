      <description>I recently built version 2 of a &amp;ldquo;master volume control&amp;rdquo; midi controller that I had made before. This version is slightly improved on the former.
It is very cheap and simple. It revolves around the wonderful and cheap (11$) Teensy LC.
Bill of materials includes:
 A 10k potentiometer A button A Teensy LC A box (I used a leftover box that had contained some wood screws - perfect size!) A few wires  All code and notes for building may be found here.</description>

      <description>Lately I have been experimenting with 14bit MIDI and found it to be a huge revelation for my work with SuperCollider. Often, the regular data range of MIDI (0-127) is way too choppy and coarse for nice interactions with your systems and instruments in SuperCollider, but 14 bit MIDI provides a resolution of 16384 steps which is great. This is actually achieved quite cleverly by combining two MIDI CC signals in to one.</description>

      <description>These are notes I have been taking while making packages for the Arch User Repository, a community based package repository for users of Arch Linux and it&amp;rsquo;s derivative operating systems. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a complete guide and certainly not beginner friendly but should help some people with some linux experience get started.
If you have a tolerance for YouTube videos, then maybe this video will be helpful to you.
It is also recommend to read the official guide on how to create packages: Creating packages.</description>

      <title>Setting up Vim and YouCompleteMe for Rust development</title>

      <description>These are notes for setting up YouCompleteMe - a program for autocompletion, code linting and debugging in the text editor Vim - for developing Rust programs. I find this program vital to my Rust workflow because it allows me to more easily explore code and correct mistakes before they reach the compiler. YouCompleteMe will tell you if there are syntactic mistakes in your code, it will tell you about unused variables and code and it will often suggest changes to problematic code.</description>
